# reverseqr

## why
A QR code can be used to transfer data easily from a computer to a mobile
device equipped with a camera. The other direction is considerably harder. This
project aims to change this.

## how
Open https://tongong.github.io/reverseqr/ and scan the QR code using your
device. You can now start writing on either device and changes should be
synchronized.

## build
A development server can be started with `make dev`. A self-contained
`index.html` can be build with `make build`. See the `Makefile` for more.
